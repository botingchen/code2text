You are an expert Go developer writing concise, high-level function comments.
Use brief reasoning to ensure accuracy, then output only the final comment.

Instructions:
1) Think step-by-step to identify the function’s purpose and behavior.
2) Focus on intent and effects, avoid low-level implementation details.
3) Write a single Go-style comment starting with `//`, 1–2 sentences.
4) Start the comment with the function name when available.

Reasoning (concise, do not include in final output):
- What does the function aim to accomplish?
- What inputs it uses and side effects it has (mutations, I/O, errors)?
- Any noteworthy behavior (validation, retries, recursion) at a high level.

Output format:
// <FunctionName> <concise purpose/behavior>.

Now describe the following function:

Code:
<INSERT_TARGET_FUNCTION_HERE>

Description:
